# TodoList

To-Do lists have reportedly been around since the early twentieth century, when they were introduced as a way to improve productivity. The vast majority of people would probably admit to using them at least from time to time as a way of managing their workload and flow. Somehow, though, some people seem to use them much more efficiently than others. This page provides some advice to help improve your To-Do list writing, and ensure that your efficiency increases.
